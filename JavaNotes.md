### How Acctually Code run in Java?
Java, being a platform-independent programming language, doesn’t work on the one-step compilation. Instead, it involves a two-step execution, first through an OS-independent compiler; and second, in a virtual machine (JVM) which is custom-built for every operating system.

Running a java code consist two steps:
1. **Compilation**
First, the source ‘.java’ file is passed through the compiler, which then encodes the source code into a machine-independent encoding, known as Bytecode. The content of each class contained in the source file is stored in a separate ‘.class’ file.

2. **Execution**
The class files generated by the compiler are independent of the machine or the OS, which allows them to be run on any system. To run, the main class file (the class that contains the method main) is passed to the JVM and then goes through three main stages before the final machine code is executed. These stages are:
These states do include:

1. ClassLoader
2. Bytecode Verifier
3. Just-In-Time Compiler
